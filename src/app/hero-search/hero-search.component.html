<!-- Actually a nice example of how I should best treat a searchbar component. Even for react. -->
<div id="search-component">
  <label>Hero Search</label>
  <input #searchBox id="search-box" (input)="search(searchBox.value)" />
  <ul class="search-result">
    <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes$ | async">
      <a routerLink="/detail/{{ hero.id }}">
        {{ hero.name }}
        <!-- for my project, it should have been clickable results
                     that you can add to see it show up in the main board.
                    heroes$ stands for Observable, so in my understanding
                    Promises in an array. 
                    piped to async, so it's subscribed(?) to it and can be fetched?

      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
