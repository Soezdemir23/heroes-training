# HeroesTraining

## Motivation behind it

Learning the basics of Angular and get a feeling about how it works.
I learned a lot about it, also saw some parallels with React.js.
I commented my findings and thought process inside the components.

### Parts where I commented my thought process and understanding

  + html
  + ts

  + ts
+ hero-search:
  + html
  + ts
+ app-routing.module.ts

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
